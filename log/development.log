The tension between tradition and progress is almost as taught as that between mercy and brutality, as the clan‚Äôs rise to drug-running prominence comes at a catastrophic cost.

Also channeling the spirit of Robert Altman, Brian De Palma, Alfred Hitchcock and Hollywood golden-age classics (set to a Henry Mancini-esque score), Sam‚Äôs cine-odyssey is a quest for meaning in an overstuffed pop-culture world. Movies and myths collide, both mirthfully and mournful, as Sam strives to uncover the knotty conspiracy-theory connections linking everything and everyone. From Super Mario Bros., new-age cultists, pirates and bomb-shelter tombs, to masturbatory porn patterns, dog killers, comic books (Spider-Man, wink wink) and song lyrics scribbled on pizza boxes, secret world-governing ciphers are ubiquitous. Mitchell reveals them through an adventure that‚Äôs witty, aesthetically dexterous, and laced with dark disillusionment about the puppetmaster powers-that-be and their covert machinations. Reconfiguring noir‚Äôs fatalistic heart for our tangled modern condition, it‚Äôs a portrait of the surreal new bleakness, with everything part of a grander whole that offers no substance or solace ‚Äì leaving only that eternal desire for truth, and togetherness."]]

Arriving in Marseilles, he befriends the African son (Lilien Batman) and wife (Maryam Zaree) of a former comrade. Through circumstance, he also assumes the guise of famous writer Weidel, whose possessions he acquires and whose documentation permitting travel to Mexico await him at the port city‚Äôs embassy. So too does Weidel‚Äôs wife Marie (Paula Beer), who repeatedly mistakes Georg for her husband, and who longs for reunion even as she continues an affair with a man (Godehard Giese) whose obsessive amour prevents him from departing. Borders to cross and barriers impeding passage are omnipresent in Transit, which like so much of writer/director Christian Petzold‚Äôs transition-fixated oeuvre, is a forlorn romantic reverie about identity, regret, trauma and rebirth. Moreover, it‚Äôs another of his masterworks to confront issues of personal and national consciousness through a distinct cine-filter, with Casablanca and The Passenger proving two of its many spiritual touchstones. Its characters linked by spectral bonds they can feel if not quite identify (or control), it‚Äôs an entrancing and inherently mysterious ghost story that‚Äôs both timeless and, sadly, of our particular moment."]]

Using revolutionary (and largely effective) de-aging CGI to make his cast appear decades younger, the director‚Äôs adaptation of Charles Brandt‚Äôs non-fiction book I Heard You Paint Houses recounts the criminal life of Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro), an enforcer for mafioso Russell Bufalino (Joe Pesci) and close compatriot of Teamsters bigwig Jimmy Hoffa (Pacino), the latter of whom he reportedly executed in 1975. An era-spanning tale that charts the intersections of the mob and domestic politics (including the election and assassination of JFK), Scorsese‚Äôs film is also a flashback-layered drama about the passage of time, and the impact ‚Äì or chilling lack thereof ‚Äì that regret, treachery and immorality have on a man‚Äôs soul. Led by bravura turns from its leads (Pesci quiet and menacing; De Niro stoic and empty; Pacino fiery and charismatic), it‚Äôs an epic about American corruption and underworld dishonor."]]

The separation of Brooklyn theater director Charlie (Adam Driver) and actress Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) begins with amicable intentions but soon devolves into a costly and traumatizing legal war that‚Äôs carried out by cutthroat, self-interested lawyers (Laura Dern, Ray Liotta), and strands the couple‚Äôs young son Henry (Azhy Robertson) in the middle of a figurative (and, at one point, literal) tug of war. Their ensuing custody fight centers on which coast their kid will call home, and Baumbach‚Äôs sharp writing and visuals‚Äîfull of close-ups of pain and fury, and remote compositions that separate and isolate his adrift protagonists‚Äîlocates the way in which that battle inevitably warps that which was once good, leaving only resentment and ruin in its wake. No film on the subject has ever been this bracingly true to life, and much of the credit for that triumph goes to Driver and Johansson, whose superlative dueling performances‚Äîwounded and righteous, forlorn and furious, and marked by respective musical numbers‚Äîare as subtle as they are wrenchingly real."]]

On a New England rock enshrouded in crashing-wave mist and bombarded with torrential rain, 19th-century lighthouse keepers Thomas Wake (Willem Dafoe) and Ephraim Winslow (Robert Pattinson) tend to their duties, with the former manning the illuminated tower and the latter maintaining their domicile and coal-burning furnace. Their laborious toil is compounded first by interpersonal tensions over Wake‚Äôs possessiveness regarding the lighthouse itself, and then by run-ins with squawking gulls (vessels for dead sailors‚Äô spirits, says Wake) and visions of slimy tentacles and inviting mermaids. Shot in luminously grainy 4:3 black-and-white that gives the action the look of a weathered old photograph, scored to unholy bellowing and siren shrieks, and driven by ornate storybook dialogue fit for a nautical nightmare, it‚Äôs a film about guilt, shame and greed (and the psychosis it begets) that exudes cramped, soggy malevolence. Dafoe‚Äôs curse to the maritime gods is an all-timer, and a superb Pattinson matches his sloshed, wild-eyed lunacy step for floorboard-creaking step. Eggers eventually drowns his material in slithering sexualized imagery of a crazed sort, and caps things off in a manner that‚Äôs all the more cautionary-tale haunting for remaining so unforgettably oblique."]]

In his debut, the critic-turned-writer/director cuts efficiently, so that no gesture or expression is wasted, and yet he also tends to linger ‚Äì on a notepad‚Äôs to-do list, or a face trying to hide the reality behind a recent utterance ‚Äì in order to evoke greater unspoken truths. Buoyed by a script attuned to the sorrowful rhythms of older age (and New England), Jones‚Äô film rests on the shoulders of Place‚Äôs stellar, lived-in performance as Diane, a fallible woman whose selflessness is colored by anger and regret."]]

An era-spanning tale that charts the intersections of the mob and domestic politics (including the election and assassination of JFK), Scorsese‚Äôs film is also a flashback-layered drama about the passage of time, and the impact ‚Äì or chilling lack thereof ‚Äì that regret, treachery and immorality have on a man‚Äôs soul. Led by bravura turns from its leads (Pesci quiet and menacing; De Niro stoic and empty; Pacino fiery and charismatic), it‚Äôs an epic about American corruption and underworld dishonor."]]

The separation of Brooklyn theater director Charlie (Adam Driver) and actress Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) begins with amicable intentions but soon devolves into a costly and traumatizing legal war that‚Äôs carried out by cutthroat, self-interested lawyers (Laura Dern, Ray Liotta), and strands the couple‚Äôs young son Henry (Azhy Robertson) in the middle of a figurative (and, at one point, literal) tug of war. Their ensuing custody fight centers on which coast their kid will call home, and Baumbach‚Äôs sharp writing and visuals‚Äîfull of close-ups of pain and fury, and remote compositions that separate and isolate his adrift protagonists‚Äîlocates the way in which that battle inevitably warps that which was once good, leaving only resentment and ruin in its wake. No film on the subject has ever been this bracingly true to life, and much of the credit for that triumph goes to Driver and Johansson, whose superlative dueling performances‚Äîwounded and righteous, forlorn and furious, and marked by respective musical numbers‚Äîare as subtle as they are wrenchingly real."]]

On a New England rock enshrouded in crashing-wave mist and bombarded with torrential rain, 19th-century lighthouse keepers Thomas Wake (Willem Dafoe) and Ephraim Winslow (Robert Pattinson) tend to their duties, with the former manning the illuminated tower and the latter maintaining their domicile and coal-burning furnace. Their laborious toil is compounded first by interpersonal tensions over Wake‚Äôs possessiveness regarding the lighthouse itself, and then by run-ins with squawking gulls (vessels for dead sailors‚Äô spirits, says Wake) and visions of slimy tentacles and inviting mermaids. Shot in luminously grainy 4:3 black-and-white that gives the action the look of a weathered old photograph, scored to unholy bellowing and siren shrieks, and driven by ornate storybook dialogue fit for a nautical nightmare, it‚Äôs a film about guilt, shame and greed (and the psychosis it begets) that exudes cramped, soggy malevolence. Dafoe‚Äôs curse to the maritime gods is an all-timer, and a superb Pattinson matches his sloshed, wild-eyed lunacy step for floorboard-creaking step. Eggers eventually drowns his material in slithering sexualized imagery of a crazed sort, and caps things off in a manner that‚Äôs all the more cautionary-tale haunting for remaining so unforgettably oblique."]]
