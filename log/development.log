The tension between tradition and progress is almost as taught as that between mercy and brutality, as the clan‚Äôs rise to drug-running prominence comes at a catastrophic cost.

Also channeling the spirit of Robert Altman, Brian De Palma, Alfred Hitchcock and Hollywood golden-age classics (set to a Henry Mancini-esque score), Sam‚Äôs cine-odyssey is a quest for meaning in an overstuffed pop-culture world. Movies and myths collide, both mirthfully and mournful, as Sam strives to uncover the knotty conspiracy-theory connections linking everything and everyone. From Super Mario Bros., new-age cultists, pirates and bomb-shelter tombs, to masturbatory porn patterns, dog killers, comic books (Spider-Man, wink wink) and song lyrics scribbled on pizza boxes, secret world-governing ciphers are ubiquitous. Mitchell reveals them through an adventure that‚Äôs witty, aesthetically dexterous, and laced with dark disillusionment about the puppetmaster powers-that-be and their covert machinations. Reconfiguring noir‚Äôs fatalistic heart for our tangled modern condition, it‚Äôs a portrait of the surreal new bleakness, with everything part of a grander whole that offers no substance or solace ‚Äì leaving only that eternal desire for truth, and togetherness."]]

Arriving in Marseilles, he befriends the African son (Lilien Batman) and wife (Maryam Zaree) of a former comrade. Through circumstance, he also assumes the guise of famous writer Weidel, whose possessions he acquires and whose documentation permitting travel to Mexico await him at the port city‚Äôs embassy. So too does Weidel‚Äôs wife Marie (Paula Beer), who repeatedly mistakes Georg for her husband, and who longs for reunion even as she continues an affair with a man (Godehard Giese) whose obsessive amour prevents him from departing. Borders to cross and barriers impeding passage are omnipresent in Transit, which like so much of writer/director Christian Petzold‚Äôs transition-fixated oeuvre, is a forlorn romantic reverie about identity, regret, trauma and rebirth. Moreover, it‚Äôs another of his masterworks to confront issues of personal and national consciousness through a distinct cine-filter, with Casablanca and The Passenger proving two of its many spiritual touchstones. Its characters linked by spectral bonds they can feel if not quite identify (or control), it‚Äôs an entrancing and inherently mysterious ghost story that‚Äôs both timeless and, sadly, of our particular moment."]]

Using revolutionary (and largely effective) de-aging CGI to make his cast appear decades younger, the director‚Äôs adaptation of Charles Brandt‚Äôs non-fiction book I Heard You Paint Houses recounts the criminal life of Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro), an enforcer for mafioso Russell Bufalino (Joe Pesci) and close compatriot of Teamsters bigwig Jimmy Hoffa (Pacino), the latter of whom he reportedly executed in 1975. An era-spanning tale that charts the intersections of the mob and domestic politics (including the election and assassination of JFK), Scorsese‚Äôs film is also a flashback-layered drama about the passage of time, and the impact ‚Äì or chilling lack thereof ‚Äì that regret, treachery and immorality have on a man‚Äôs soul. Led by bravura turns from its leads (Pesci quiet and menacing; De Niro stoic and empty; Pacino fiery and charismatic), it‚Äôs an epic about American corruption and underworld dishonor."]]

The separation of Brooklyn theater director Charlie (Adam Driver) and actress Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) begins with amicable intentions but soon devolves into a costly and traumatizing legal war that‚Äôs carried out by cutthroat, self-interested lawyers (Laura Dern, Ray Liotta), and strands the couple‚Äôs young son Henry (Azhy Robertson) in the middle of a figurative (and, at one point, literal) tug of war. Their ensuing custody fight centers on which coast their kid will call home, and Baumbach‚Äôs sharp writing and visuals‚Äîfull of close-ups of pain and fury, and remote compositions that separate and isolate his adrift protagonists‚Äîlocates the way in which that battle inevitably warps that which was once good, leaving only resentment and ruin in its wake. No film on the subject has ever been this bracingly true to life, and much of the credit for that triumph goes to Driver and Johansson, whose superlative dueling performances‚Äîwounded and righteous, forlorn and furious, and marked by respective musical numbers‚Äîare as subtle as they are wrenchingly real."]]

On a New England rock enshrouded in crashing-wave mist and bombarded with torrential rain, 19th-century lighthouse keepers Thomas Wake (Willem Dafoe) and Ephraim Winslow (Robert Pattinson) tend to their duties, with the former manning the illuminated tower and the latter maintaining their domicile and coal-burning furnace. Their laborious toil is compounded first by interpersonal tensions over Wake‚Äôs possessiveness regarding the lighthouse itself, and then by run-ins with squawking gulls (vessels for dead sailors‚Äô spirits, says Wake) and visions of slimy tentacles and inviting mermaids. Shot in luminously grainy 4:3 black-and-white that gives the action the look of a weathered old photograph, scored to unholy bellowing and siren shrieks, and driven by ornate storybook dialogue fit for a nautical nightmare, it‚Äôs a film about guilt, shame and greed (and the psychosis it begets) that exudes cramped, soggy malevolence. Dafoe‚Äôs curse to the maritime gods is an all-timer, and a superb Pattinson matches his sloshed, wild-eyed lunacy step for floorboard-creaking step. Eggers eventually drowns his material in slithering sexualized imagery of a crazed sort, and caps things off in a manner that‚Äôs all the more cautionary-tale haunting for remaining so unforgettably oblique."]]

In his debut, the critic-turned-writer/director cuts efficiently, so that no gesture or expression is wasted, and yet he also tends to linger ‚Äì on a notepad‚Äôs to-do list, or a face trying to hide the reality behind a recent utterance ‚Äì in order to evoke greater unspoken truths. Buoyed by a script attuned to the sorrowful rhythms of older age (and New England), Jones‚Äô film rests on the shoulders of Place‚Äôs stellar, lived-in performance as Diane, a fallible woman whose selflessness is colored by anger and regret."]]

An era-spanning tale that charts the intersections of the mob and domestic politics (including the election and assassination of JFK), Scorsese‚Äôs film is also a flashback-layered drama about the passage of time, and the impact ‚Äì or chilling lack thereof ‚Äì that regret, treachery and immorality have on a man‚Äôs soul. Led by bravura turns from its leads (Pesci quiet and menacing; De Niro stoic and empty; Pacino fiery and charismatic), it‚Äôs an epic about American corruption and underworld dishonor."]]

The separation of Brooklyn theater director Charlie (Adam Driver) and actress Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) begins with amicable intentions but soon devolves into a costly and traumatizing legal war that‚Äôs carried out by cutthroat, self-interested lawyers (Laura Dern, Ray Liotta), and strands the couple‚Äôs young son Henry (Azhy Robertson) in the middle of a figurative (and, at one point, literal) tug of war. Their ensuing custody fight centers on which coast their kid will call home, and Baumbach‚Äôs sharp writing and visuals‚Äîfull of close-ups of pain and fury, and remote compositions that separate and isolate his adrift protagonists‚Äîlocates the way in which that battle inevitably warps that which was once good, leaving only resentment and ruin in its wake. No film on the subject has ever been this bracingly true to life, and much of the credit for that triumph goes to Driver and Johansson, whose superlative dueling performances‚Äîwounded and righteous, forlorn and furious, and marked by respective musical numbers‚Äîare as subtle as they are wrenchingly real."]]

On a New England rock enshrouded in crashing-wave mist and bombarded with torrential rain, 19th-century lighthouse keepers Thomas Wake (Willem Dafoe) and Ephraim Winslow (Robert Pattinson) tend to their duties, with the former manning the illuminated tower and the latter maintaining their domicile and coal-burning furnace. Their laborious toil is compounded first by interpersonal tensions over Wake‚Äôs possessiveness regarding the lighthouse itself, and then by run-ins with squawking gulls (vessels for dead sailors‚Äô spirits, says Wake) and visions of slimy tentacles and inviting mermaids. Shot in luminously grainy 4:3 black-and-white that gives the action the look of a weathered old photograph, scored to unholy bellowing and siren shrieks, and driven by ornate storybook dialogue fit for a nautical nightmare, it‚Äôs a film about guilt, shame and greed (and the psychosis it begets) that exudes cramped, soggy malevolence. Dafoe‚Äôs curse to the maritime gods is an all-timer, and a superb Pattinson matches his sloshed, wild-eyed lunacy step for floorboard-creaking step. Eggers eventually drowns his material in slithering sexualized imagery of a crazed sort, and caps things off in a manner that‚Äôs all the more cautionary-tale haunting for remaining so unforgettably oblique."]]

Improving on Chapter 2, director Stahelski stages his set pieces as exercises in vicious physicality. Through it all, Keanu Reeves strikes a dashing pose as the increasingly harried (and bloodied) Wick, his trademark designer suits and walk-softly-and-carry-a-big-gun demeanor once again employed to expert effect in a series that continues, like Reeves himself, to improve with age."]]

Beginning, portentously, with interviews seen on a television set surrounded by the director‚Äôs favorite VHS horror films, the French auteur‚Äôs latest is arguably his least provocative to date. Regardless, it‚Äôs still an escalating freak-out scored to thumping electronica and populated by a raft of potential monsters. Even during its more serene earlygoing, his characters‚Äô choreographed numbers exhibit a frightening intensity, and once these artists unwittingly drink some LSD-spiked punch, their emotional equilibrium and interpersonal relationships spiral terrifyingly out of control. Often executed in long single takes, No√©‚Äôs swirling, floating, slithering camerawork is as dexterous as his physically agile subjects. The result is an aesthetic performance piece that feels like the psychosexual underworld dance extravaganza that Luca Guadagnino‚Äôs Suspiria wanted to be, replete with a finale that takes up residence in some hallucinatory ninth circle of Hell."]]

Also channeling the spirit of Robert Altman, Brian De Palma, Alfred Hitchcock and Hollywood golden-age classics (set to a Henry Mancini-esque score), Sam‚Äôs cine-odyssey is a quest for meaning in an overstuffed pop-culture world. Movies and myths collide, both mirthfully and mournful, as Sam strives to uncover the knotty conspiracy-theory connections linking everything and everyone. From Super Mario Bros., new-age cultists, pirates and bomb-shelter tombs, to masturbatory porn patterns, dog killers, comic books (Spider-Man, wink wink) and song lyrics scribbled on pizza boxes, secret world-governing ciphers are ubiquitous. Mitchell reveals them through an adventure that‚Äôs witty, aesthetically dexterous, and laced with dark disillusionment about the puppetmaster powers-that-be and their covert machinations. Reconfiguring noir‚Äôs fatalistic heart for our tangled modern condition, it‚Äôs a portrait of the surreal new bleakness, with everything part of a grander whole that offers no substance or solace ‚Äì leaving only that eternal desire for truth, and togetherness."]]

Arriving in Marseilles, he befriends the African son (Lilien Batman) and wife (Maryam Zaree) of a former comrade. Through circumstance, he also assumes the guise of famous writer Weidel, whose possessions he acquires and whose documentation permitting travel to Mexico await him at the port city‚Äôs embassy. So too does Weidel‚Äôs wife Marie (Paula Beer), who repeatedly mistakes Georg for her husband, and who longs for reunion even as she continues an affair with a man (Godehard Giese) whose obsessive amour prevents him from departing. Borders to cross and barriers impeding passage are omnipresent in Transit, which like so much of writer/director Christian Petzold‚Äôs transition-fixated oeuvre, is a forlorn romantic reverie about identity, regret, trauma and rebirth. Moreover, it‚Äôs another of his masterworks to confront issues of personal and national consciousness through a distinct cine-filter, with Casablanca and The Passenger proving two of its many spiritual touchstones. Its characters linked by spectral bonds they can feel if not quite identify (or control), it‚Äôs an entrancing and inherently mysterious ghost story that‚Äôs both timeless and, sadly, of our particular moment."]]

Using revolutionary (and largely effective) de-aging CGI to make his cast appear decades younger, the director‚Äôs adaptation of Charles Brandt‚Äôs non-fiction book I Heard You Paint Houses recounts the criminal life of Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro), an enforcer for mafioso Russell Bufalino (Joe Pesci) and close compatriot of Teamsters bigwig Jimmy Hoffa (Pacino), the latter of whom he reportedly executed in 1975. An era-spanning tale that charts the intersections of the mob and domestic politics (including the election and assassination of JFK), Scorsese‚Äôs film is also a flashback-layered drama about the passage of time, and the impact ‚Äì or chilling lack thereof ‚Äì that regret, treachery and immorality have on a man‚Äôs soul. Led by bravura turns from its leads (Pesci quiet and menacing; De Niro stoic and empty; Pacino fiery and charismatic), it‚Äôs an epic about American corruption and underworld dishonor."]]

Their laborious toil is compounded first by interpersonal tensions over Wake‚Äôs possessiveness regarding the lighthouse itself, and then by run-ins with squawking gulls (vessels for dead sailors‚Äô spirits, says Wake) and visions of slimy tentacles and inviting mermaids. Shot in luminously grainy 4:3 black-and-white that gives the action the look of a weathered old photograph, scored to unholy bellowing and siren shrieks, and driven by ornate storybook dialogue fit for a nautical nightmare, it‚Äôs a film about guilt, shame and greed (and the psychosis it begets) that exudes cramped, soggy malevolence. Dafoe‚Äôs curse to the maritime gods is an all-timer, and a superb Pattinson matches his sloshed, wild-eyed lunacy step for floorboard-creaking step. Eggers eventually drowns his material in slithering sexualized imagery of a crazed sort, and caps things off in a manner that‚Äôs all the more cautionary-tale haunting for remaining so unforgettably oblique."]]

Courtesy of that humane act, Frances ‚Äìgrieving the death of her beloved mom, as well as adjusting to her new Manhattan environs with the help of her wealthy roommate (Maika Monroe) ‚Äì nets herself a surrogate mother figure. Their friendship, however, is eventually revealed to be predicted on a lie that turns the proceedings cockeyed. Jordan laces the film with erotic undercurrents but otherwise refuses to unduly embellish his material, instead content to keep it on steady ground even as it grows loopier. It‚Äôs Huppert who truly elevates this story about twisted maternal obsessiveness, her Greta a cunning predator who uses sophistication and solitary sorrowfulness to mask more devious desires. Sad, elegant and extremely unhinged, she‚Äôs a stalker to remember."]]

His quest is fraught with literal danger and, also, emotional, psychological and spiritual peril, as Roy searches the heavens for the indifferent father that abandoned him.

That imagery boasts breathtaking scale, conveying the literal and figurative enormity of everything involved with the Apollo 11 ‚Äì making it ideally suited for IMAX.

A semi-clandestine drug habit eventually becomes a complicating factor for the duo, but the real heart of this enthralling film is Julie herself, whose interior state is brought to vivid life by the director‚Äôs intimate, aesthetically diverse approach. Awash in talk about movies and moviemaking, Hogg‚Äôs feature is elevated by Byrne‚Äôs star-making turn as a young woman caught between genuine love, her recognition that her relationship is perhaps doomed to fail, and her desire to find her voice ‚Äì personally and artistically ‚Äì on her own."]]

With a light tough that allows for instances of escapist lyricism (none better than recurring shots of Gloria spinning amidst swirling colors), Lelio fashions a tender, incisive, heartbreaking ode to the myriad complications of adulthood, where efforts to move forward are burdened by regrets, entanglements and longing for connection.

Courtesy of that humane act, Frances ‚Äìgrieving the death of her beloved mom, as well as adjusting to her new Manhattan environs with the help of her wealthy roommate (Maika Monroe) ‚Äì nets herself a surrogate mother figure. Their friendship, however, is eventually revealed to be predicted on a lie that turns the proceedings cockeyed. Jordan laces the film with erotic undercurrents but otherwise refuses to unduly embellish his material, instead content to keep it on steady ground even as it grows loopier. It‚Äôs Huppert who truly elevates this story about twisted maternal obsessiveness, her Greta a cunning predator who uses sophistication and solitary sorrowfulness to mask more devious desires. Sad, elegant and extremely unhinged, she‚Äôs a stalker to remember."]]

After nearly dying from an assault by helmeted motorcyclists, wimpy Casey (Jesse Eisenberg) finds empowerment at the karate dojo of Sensei (Alessandro Nivola), a martial-arts guru who helps him become that which he most fears. Stearns‚Äô off-kilter script is defined by awkward conversations and absurd twists, and its droll approach to its material generates considerable black humor. As he becomes more devoted to the dojo, Casey is drawn deeper into a demented space marked by homoeroticism, sexism, and devious criminality. What he learns, ultimately, is that violence has the power to both transform and corrupt ‚Äì a lesson that Eisenberg brings to amusingly wacko life via a performance in which Casey‚Äôs seething anger and resentment at his own powerlessness lies just beneath his placid surface, ready to erupt at a moment‚Äôs notice in a flurry of kicks and punches."]]

The debut feature from Hu Bo (who died shortly after production was completed) concerns a collection of individuals whose lives intersect during the course of a single day: Wei Bu (Peng Yuchang), an angry high-school student who accidentally commits a catastrophic crime; Yu Cheng (Zhang Yu), the guilt-stricken gangster brother of Wei Bu‚Äôs victim; Huang Ling (Wang Yuwen), a classmate of Wei Bu‚Äôs who‚Äôs involved with her vice dean; and Wang Jin (Liu Congxi), a grandfather being coerced by his son and daughter-in-law to move into a nursing home. Hu shoots each protracted scene in long, unbroken takes, habitually foregrounding his subjects in shallow focus while staging key action in the fuzzy background. At nearly four hours, the film imparts an overpowering sense of its characters‚Äô despair, and the misfortune that befalls them whether they remain alone or try to engage with others ‚Äì a despondency only amplified by its empathy."]]

With a light tough that allows for instances of escapist lyricism (none better than recurring shots of Gloria spinning amidst swirling colors), Lelio fashions a tender, incisive, heartbreaking ode to the myriad complications of adulthood, where efforts to move forward are burdened by regrets, entanglements and longing for connection. Led by a tour-de-force turn by Moore, whose expressive work is some of her finest to date, it‚Äôs a small-scale story with a profound understanding of life as it‚Äôs actually lived, and felt."]]

From Super Mario Bros., new-age cultists, pirates and bomb-shelter tombs, to masturbatory porn patterns, dog killers, comic books (Spider-Man, wink wink) and song lyrics scribbled on pizza boxes, secret world-governing ciphers are ubiquitous.

Split into five chapters that are interlaced with flashback home videos of happier early times, Perry‚Äôs tale traces Becky‚Äôs journey from apocalyptic drugged-out collapse to cautious resurrection, his handheld camera exactingly attuned to his protagonist‚Äôs scattershot headspace. There‚Äôs a vicarious thrill to watching this rocker spiral into the abyss, and then pull herself back out. While Moss doesn‚Äôt hold back in depicting Becky‚Äôs ugliness, she taps into the underlying hurt and vulnerability fueling her firestorm heart, peaking with a heart-rending single-take piano rendition of Bryan Adams‚Äô ‚ÄúHeaven."]]

Ruth‚Äôs flight takes her to her childhood home and her mom Bo (Lorraine Toussaint) and daughter Lila (Saniyya Sidney), both of whom have the capacity to wield swirly-colored constructive/deconstructive energy. The volatility of youth and the vitality of kinship (with present and former relatives) serve as sturdy thematic undercurrents for this low-key genre tale.

Years later, adult Albrun (Aleksandra Cwen) cares for her infant daughter in that same abode, whose only visitor is Swinda (Tanja Petrovsky), a neighbor who, like the local priest, seems concerned with saving ostracized Abrun‚Äôs soul. Light on dialogue but heavy on black-magic mystery, writer/director Lukas Feigelfeld‚Äôs fable casts its spell via slow-burn plotting and malevolent imagery, culminating with a kaleidoscopic underwater visual orgy of blood, roots, bone, tendrils, and mutating shapes. Like the mist that covers the mountainous region‚Äôs treetops, suggestions of profane forces are everywhere ‚Äì in the sight of Albrun milking her goat, or a shrine for a skull ‚Äì and they burrow under one‚Äôs skin, much like the unholy whispering and thunderous bass heard on a soundtrack that heralds madness, doom, the end."]]

Writer/director Harmony Korine‚Äôs shaggy-dog saga follows the bedraggled Moondog from one absurd adventure to the next (with, among others, Snoop Dogg, Isla Fisher, Zac Efron, Martin Lawrence and Jonah Hill), channeling both his gift for taking life as it comes, and his ability to derive sensualist pleasure from each new encounter. With long hair and a fanny pack permanently affixed around his waist, McConaughey is a magisterial stoner hedonist, and if his rollicking escapades aren‚Äôt enough to deliver a potent contact high, Korine and cinematographer Beno√Æt Debie‚Äôs rapturously colorful portrait of Florida‚Äôs posh and downtrodden milieus more than do the delirious trick."]]

Beginning, portentously, with interviews seen on a television set surrounded by the director‚Äôs favorite VHS horror films, the French auteur‚Äôs latest is arguably his least provocative to date. Regardless, it‚Äôs still an escalating freak-out scored to thumping electronica and populated by a raft of potential monsters. Even during its more serene earlygoing, his characters‚Äô choreographed numbers exhibit a frightening intensity, and once these artists unwittingly drink some LSD-spiked punch, their emotional equilibrium and interpersonal relationships spiral terrifyingly out of control. Often executed in long single takes, No√©‚Äôs swirling, floating, slithering camerawork is as dexterous as his physically agile subjects. The result is an aesthetic performance piece that feels like the psychosexual underworld dance extravaganza that Luca Guadagnino‚Äôs Suspiria wanted to be, replete with a finale that takes up residence in some hallucinatory ninth circle of Hell."]]

Also channeling the spirit of Robert Altman, Brian De Palma, Alfred Hitchcock and Hollywood golden-age classics (set to a Henry Mancini-esque score), Sam‚Äôs cine-odyssey is a quest for meaning in an overstuffed pop-culture world. Movies and myths collide, both mirthfully and mournful, as Sam strives to uncover the knotty conspiracy-theory connections linking everything and everyone. From Super Mario Bros., new-age cultists, pirates and bomb-shelter tombs, to masturbatory porn patterns, dog killers, comic books (Spider-Man, wink wink) and song lyrics scribbled on pizza boxes, secret world-governing ciphers are ubiquitous. Mitchell reveals them through an adventure that‚Äôs witty, aesthetically dexterous, and laced with dark disillusionment about the puppetmaster powers-that-be and their covert machinations. Reconfiguring noir‚Äôs fatalistic heart for our tangled modern condition, it‚Äôs a portrait of the surreal new bleakness, with everything part of a grander whole that offers no substance or solace ‚Äì leaving only that eternal desire for truth, and togetherness."]]

Through circumstance, he also assumes the guise of famous writer Weidel, whose possessions he acquires and whose documentation permitting travel to Mexico await him at the port city‚Äôs embassy. So too does Weidel‚Äôs wife Marie (Paula Beer), who repeatedly mistakes Georg for her husband, and who longs for reunion even as she continues an affair with a man (Godehard Giese) whose obsessive amour prevents him from departing. Borders to cross and barriers impeding passage are omnipresent in Transit, which like so much of writer/director Christian Petzold‚Äôs transition-fixated oeuvre, is a forlorn romantic reverie about identity, regret, trauma and rebirth. Moreover, it‚Äôs another of his masterworks to confront issues of personal and national consciousness through a distinct cine-filter, with Casablanca and The Passenger proving two of its many spiritual touchstones. Its characters linked by spectral bonds they can feel if not quite identify (or control), it‚Äôs an entrancing and inherently mysterious ghost story that‚Äôs both timeless and, sadly, of our particular moment."]]

An era-spanning tale that charts the intersections of the mob and domestic politics (including the election and assassination of JFK), Scorsese‚Äôs film is also a flashback-layered drama about the passage of time, and the impact ‚Äì or chilling lack thereof ‚Äì that regret, treachery and immorality have on a man‚Äôs soul.

Their laborious toil is compounded first by interpersonal tensions over Wake‚Äôs possessiveness regarding the lighthouse itself, and then by run-ins with squawking gulls (vessels for dead sailors‚Äô spirits, says Wake) and visions of slimy tentacles and inviting mermaids. Shot in luminously grainy 4:3 black-and-white that gives the action the look of a weathered old photograph, scored to unholy bellowing and siren shrieks, and driven by ornate storybook dialogue fit for a nautical nightmare, it‚Äôs a film about guilt, shame and greed (and the psychosis it begets) that exudes cramped, soggy malevolence. Dafoe‚Äôs curse to the maritime gods is an all-timer, and a superb Pattinson matches his sloshed, wild-eyed lunacy step for floorboard-creaking step. Eggers eventually drowns his material in slithering sexualized imagery of a crazed sort, and caps things off in a manner that‚Äôs all the more cautionary-tale haunting for remaining so unforgettably oblique."]]
